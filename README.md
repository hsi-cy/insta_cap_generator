# insta_cap_generator
IMPORTANT
You need to customise your post by yourself. The program only works with my standard post!

The code you need to change is the file called "cap_generator.py", where there is a function called "main()". You can customise your post there.


This helps create a standard post for your instagram account.
My account formation is like below

Date:
Contene:
Values:
Hashtags:

I use random choice to pick hashtags from my database (bird.csv, animal.csv)
so every post will have at least slightly different hashtags. 

To create your own hashtag database, you can gather as many related hashtags as you want on the internet and just paste them into a text file.

setOfTags function will parse the information and make sure there is no duplicate.

produceCsv function is literally produce a csv file as your database.
